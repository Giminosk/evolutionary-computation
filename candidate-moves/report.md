## Problem Description

Given a set of nodes, each characterized by their (x, y) coordinates in a plane and an associated cost, the challenge is to select exactly 50% of these nodes and form a Hamiltonian cycle. 

The goal is to minimize the sum of the total length of the path plus the total cost of the selected nodes. 

Distances between nodes are computed as Euclidean distances and rounded to the nearest integer.
